# Flask-Angular-MongoDB-Application

This is a full-stack web application using Flask (Python) for the backend, AngularJS for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database. It provides a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage personal information.

Project Structure:
flaskMONGO/
│-- project1/
│   │-- _init_.py        # Initializes Flask, MongoDB, and CORS
│   │-- routes.py        # Defines API endpoints (CRUD operations)
│   │-- run.py           # Entry point for running the Flask app
│-- angular/
│   │-- index.html       # Frontend UI (AngularJS)
│   │-- script.js        # AngularJS controller for interacting with Flask API

Learnings from this Project:
1. Full-Stack Development: Gained experience in integrating Flask, MongoDB, and AngularJS.
2. RESTful API Design: Understood API structuring and how CRUD operations work.
3. MongoDB Operations: Learned how to store and query data using PyMongo.
4. CORS Handling: Implemented Flask-CORS to enable smooth API calls from AngularJS.
5. Frontend-Backend Communication: Used $http service in AngularJS to interact with the Flask backend.
6. Debugging & Deployment: Understood common debugging techniques and how to deploy Flask apps.
